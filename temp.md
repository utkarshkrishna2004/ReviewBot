❌ Bad Code:
```python
def diff():
    return a - b
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ The function `diff` relies on global variables `a` and `b`, which makes the function's behavior unpredictable and hard to reason about.
*   ❌ The function does not have a docstring explaining its purpose.
*   ❌ There is no error handling for cases where `a` or `b` might not be defined or are of incompatible types.
*   ❌ The function name `diff` is not very descriptive; it would be better to name it something like `subtract_numbers`.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```python
def subtract_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    Subtracts two numbers and returns the result.

    Args:
        a: The number to subtract from.
        b: The number to subtract.

    Returns:
        The result of the subtraction.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If either `a` or `b` is not a number.
    """
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers")
    return a - b
```

💡 Improvements:
*   ✔ Takes `a` and `b` as parameters, making the function self-contained and predictable.
*   ✔ Includes a docstring that explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
*   ✔ Added type hints for the parameters and return value to improve readability and help catch type errors.
*   ✔ Includes error handling to raise a `TypeError` if either `a` or `b` is not a number.
*   ✔ The function name has been changed to `subtract_numbers` to be more descriptive.
